# Project Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the project based on the requirements specified in `requirements.md`. The plan is organized by key areas of the system and includes rationale for each proposed change.

## 1. Architecture and Code Structure

### 1.1 Modular Architecture Enhancement

**Current State**: The application follows a basic MVC pattern with controllers, models, and routes. However, as the application grows, this structure may become difficult to maintain.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Implement a service layer between controllers and models to encapsulate business logic
- Adopt a domain-driven design approach for complex business rules
- Create utility modules for cross-cutting concerns

**Rationale**: Separating business logic from controllers will improve code reusability, testability, and maintainability. This will make it easier to implement new features and modify existing ones without affecting other parts of the system.

### 1.2 Error Handling Standardization

**Current State**: Error handling is implemented but could be more consistent across the application.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Create a centralized error handling service with standardized error codes
- Implement custom error classes for different types of errors
- Add more detailed logging for errors with contextual information

**Rationale**: Standardized error handling will improve debugging, provide better error messages to clients, and make the application more robust.
