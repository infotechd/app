# Project Requirements

## System Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a web-based platform that appears to facilitate service offerings, contracting, and community interactions. The system consists of a backend API built with Express.js and MongoDB, and a frontend client application.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization
- User registration and login functionality
- Role-based access control (different permissions for different user types)
- Secure token-based authentication using JWT
- Password reset capabilities

### Service Offerings
- Users can create, read, update, and delete service offerings
- Service offerings should include details like description, pricing, and availability
- Search and filter functionality for service offerings

### Contracting
- Users can initiate contract negotiations for services
- Contract lifecycle management (creation, negotiation, acceptance, completion)
- Payment integration for service contracts

### Community Features
- Users can create and interact with community publications
- Comment functionality on publications
- Like/reaction system for community content
- User blocking capabilities for moderation

### Scheduling
- Calendar integration for service providers
- Ability to block specific time slots in agenda
- Appointment scheduling and management

### Profiles and Resumes
- User profile management
- Resume/CV upload and management for service providers
- Rating and review system for service providers

### Real-time Communication
- Real-time notifications using Socket.IO
- Chat functionality between users
- Status updates for contract negotiations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time should be under 500ms for 95% of requests
- System should support at least 1000 concurrent users
- Database queries should be optimized for large datasets

### Security
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure handling of authentication tokens

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability for the backend services
- Efficient database indexing and query optimization
- Potential for microservices architecture in future iterations

### Reliability
- System uptime target of 99.9%
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Regular data backups

### Usability
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop interfaces
- Intuitive user interface with clear navigation
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Multi-language support

## Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB
- Frontend: Not specified but likely React or similar framework
- Real-time communication: Socket.IO
- Authentication: JWT-based

### Development Constraints
- RESTful API design principles
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular architecture for maintainability
- Comprehensive test coverage required
- Documentation for all APIs

### Deployment Constraints
- Containerization using Docker
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Monitoring and alerting system integration

## Business Constraints
- Time-to-market is critical for competitive advantage
- Budget limitations require efficient resource utilization
- Compliance with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- Integration with existing business systems may be required
