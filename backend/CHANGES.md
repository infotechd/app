# Backend Changes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

1. **Security Issue in Cookie Settings**
   - Fixed the `sameSite` cookie setting in the login function
   - Changed from `'none'` to `'lax'` in development mode for better security while maintaining functionality
   - This prevents potential CSRF attacks while still allowing cross-site requests in legitimate scenarios

2. **Improved CPF/CNPJ Validation**
   - Implemented full validation algorithms for both CPF and CNPJ
   - Previous validation only checked length and if all digits were the same
   - New validation performs the proper mathematical validation for both document types
   - This ensures only valid document numbers are accepted

3. **Fixed Schema-Controller Mismatch**
   - Removed the requirement for 'id' or 'idUsuario' fields in the updateUserSchema
   - The controller was using the userId from the JWT token, not from these fields
   - This alignment prevents validation errors during profile updates

4. **Improved Error Handling in Password Comparison**
   - Modified the comparePassword method to properly throw errors instead of silently returning false
   - Added more detailed logging with user context
   - This makes it easier to identify and fix issues with password comparison

5. **Enhanced Telephone Formatting**
   - Improved the telephone formatting in the pre-save hook
   - Added better error logging with more context
   - Added validation for unexpected formats
   - Prevents saving improperly formatted telephone numbers
   - This ensures data consistency

6. **Fixed Schema-Model Inconsistency**
   - Replaced the tipoUsuario field in the schema with an isAdmin boolean field
   - This aligns with the User model which uses isAdmin, not tipoUsuario
   - Ensures consistency between schema and model

## Testing

A test script has been created to verify the authentication flow:
- User registration with valid data
- User login with the registered credentials
- Profile retrieval using the JWT token
- Profile update with new data

To run the tests:
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Run the test script: `node src/tests/auth-test.js`

A health check script is also available to verify if the server is running:
`node src/tests/health-check.js`

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Implement Refresh Token Storage**
   - Currently, refresh tokens are not stored in a database
   - This makes it impossible to revoke them if needed
   - Consider storing refresh tokens in a database with an association to the user

2. **Review Extensive Logging**
   - The editProfile function has extensive logging that might expose sensitive information
   - Consider reducing logging in production or masking sensitive data

3. **Reconsider Login Rate Limiting**
   - Current rate limiting (3 attempts per 15 minutes) might be too strict
   - Consider a more gradual approach with increasing timeouts

4. **Enable Admin Middleware**
   - The isAdmin middleware is imported but commented out in routes
   - Consider enabling it for better security on admin routes

5. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all controllers and models
   - This will help catch issues early and ensure changes don't break existing functionality

6. **Implement Email and CPF/CNPJ Validation Libraries**
   - There are commented-out imports for email and CPF/CNPJ validation
   - Consider using these specialized libraries for more robust validation

## Conclusion

The backend code has been improved with better security, validation, and error handling. These changes make the application more robust and secure while maintaining functionality. Regular testing and ongoing improvements will help ensure the application continues to meet user needs and security requirements.
